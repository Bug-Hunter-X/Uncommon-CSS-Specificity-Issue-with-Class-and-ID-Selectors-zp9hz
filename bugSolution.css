The solution focuses on refactoring the CSS to avoid ambiguity and use more straightforward selectors:

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
}

#container {
  width: 300px; /* This will override .container if #container is applied directly to an element */
}

/*Remove this selector; it is usually not necessary and prone to errors.  */
/*.container #container {
  width: 400px;
}*/

```

By separating the styles for `.container` and `#container`, we eliminate any potential conflicts and ensure that the styles are applied predictably.  If an element requires both classes and IDs, ensure that each style is assigned correctly based on the desired element selection.  Prioritize simplicity and clear style assignments for better maintainability.
