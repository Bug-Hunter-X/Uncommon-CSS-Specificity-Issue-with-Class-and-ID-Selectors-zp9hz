# Uncommon CSS Specificity Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic issue related to CSS selector specificity when combining class and ID selectors.  The problem arises from the way CSS handles the specificity of rules when an element might have both a class and an ID applied, especially in nested scenarios. While generally straightforward, this interaction can be confusing and may lead to unexpected visual outcomes.

## Description

The core problem revolves around the higher specificity of ID selectors compared to class selectors.  However, situations where a combined selector such as `.container #container` is used can create unnecessary complexities and unexpected behaviors, especially when not carefully considering the HTML structure.  This is uncommon in typical CSS usage.

## Solution

The recommended solution is to avoid unnecessarily complex selectors and rely on clear and well-structured HTML.  Maintain consistency in how you assign classes and IDs to prevent unintended style conflicts. 

More specifically, avoid cases where selectors target nested elements when they could be targeted directly in the parent and child elements individually.  This ensures a more understandable and maintainable CSS style sheet.
